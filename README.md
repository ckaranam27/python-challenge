Option 1: PyBank

Analyzing the financial records of the company with given two sets of revenue date (`budget_data_1.csv` and `budget_data_2.csv`) . Each dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Revenue`.

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

```
Financial Analysis

Total Months: 25
Total Revenue: $1241412
Average Revenue Change: $216825
Greatest Increase in Revenue: Sep-16 ($815531)
